Hey crew!
This is our team GitHub repo for our Python Showcase Project.

#Project Idea: An Artificial Intelligence Secretary

We will be using a multitude of technologies for this project, including:
Python, Google Calendar API for Scheduling, OpenCV API for Facial Recognition

The basic concept is to build an AI that is complex enough to adequately handle customers or clients as a stand in receptionist when a human is not available. It will be able to schedule appointments, compare available openings between business hours and the client's Google Calendar and make suggestions, identify clients using facial recognition, etc. all from a kiosk.

We may add the ability to scan barcodes or read RFID tags to further help identify clients. We may also end up building a web app and wrapper for mobile apps so that clients can access the AI at any time if they need to schedule or re-schedule an appointment, make changes, or request information.
